# Create an experimental plan
The experimental plan is the core tool to document synthesis.
You should at least have created some processes, eg. `wet chemical depositions` as in [create_wet_chemical_deposition.md](create_wet_chemical_deposition.md), or cleaning or evaporation.
Or you create a `standard sample` as in [create_standard_sample.md](create_standard_sample.md)

Follow the first  steps in [create_entry.md](create_entry.md).
1. Select `HySprint_ExperimentalPlan` as a `built-in schema`
